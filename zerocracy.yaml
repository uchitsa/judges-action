    the penalty amount is -10.
  greeting: 'It is not a good idea to name Git branches the way you named this one:
    "`renovate/zerocracy-judges-action-0.x`". You''ve earned -10 points for this (-10
    as a basis). Next time, give your branch the same name as the number of the ticket
    that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name would be "`101`". '

  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in yegor256/factbase, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-316](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

    -10 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of
    the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would

  greeting: "I've analyzed the work policy document and reviewed the draft message
    to the programmer. Here's a rewritten version of the message that's more conversational,
    incorporates relevant points from the policy, and aims to be more motivating:\n\nHey
    there! Thanks for jumping in on this review. I've got some good news and some
    room for improvement for you.\n\nSo, here's the scoop: You've earned 15 points
    for this review. Not bad, but let me break it down for you:\n\nYou started with
    a solid 25-point base - that's automatic for every review. Nice! \n\nNow, I noticed
    you only left one comment. The policy encourages more engagement, aiming for at
    least 6 comments to avoid a 10-point deduction. Unfortunately, we had to apply
    that deduction here.\n\nBut hey, look on the bright side! You didn't review your
    own code (that would've cost you 40 points), and you showed up to participate.
    That's great!\n\nWant to boost your points next time? Here are some tips:\n1.
    Leave more comments - you can earn up to 20 points for that!\n2. If you're reviewing
    a larger piece of code (15+ hits-of-code), you'll avoid another 10-point deduction.\n3.
    The more substantial the code review, the more points you can rack up (up to 40
    points for the code size alone).\n\nYour current balance is -579, but don't let
    that discourage you. Every review is a chance to climb up. Remember, you can earn
    up to 100 points per review!\n\nKeep at it, and let's see those points soar. You've
    got this!"

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Great job on the review! You've snagged 24 points
    for this one. Here's the breakdown: 25 points as a base, plus 9 points for tackling
    those 93 hits-of-code (nice!). We had to deduct 10 points due to the low comment
    count (only 3), but don't sweat it! Remember, more comments can boost your score
    next time. Keep in mind, we're aiming for at least 6 comments and 15+ hits-of-code
    for maximum impact. Your current balance sits at [-535](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Keep up the great work and let's see those points climb! \U0001F4AA"

  greeting: "Hey there, awesome job on your contribution! \U0001F389 You've racked
    up +29 points: 25 for the base, and a sweet 9 points for your 197 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html).
    We did have to deduct 5 points due to the low comment count (only 4), but don't
    sweat it! Remember, more comments can boost your score next time. Keep the code
    coming and aim for that 80-point max! Your current balance is [+268](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Let's see you hit that 800 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    milestone soon – just watch out for that 15-point deduction! \U0001F609 [Keep
    up](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) the great work!"

  greeting: "Hey there, rockstar coder! \U0001F680 Awesome job on your recent contribution!
    You've racked up a sweet +29 points: 20 for showing up and an extra 9 for those
    193 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html) you
    cranked out. That's some solid work, just shy of the 200 HOC mark where we start
    deducting points. Keep the code flowing, but remember, [quality matters](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    too! Your total score is now sitting pretty at [+240](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Keep up the great work and don't forget to engage with those code reviews – they
    can boost your points even higher!"

  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/baza.rb, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
