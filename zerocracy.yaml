    the penalty amount is -10.
  greeting: 'It is not a good idea to name Git branches the way you named this one:
    "`renovate/zerocracy-judges-action-0.x`". You''ve earned -10 points for this (-10
    as a basis). Next time, give your branch the same name as the number of the ticket
    that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name would be "`101`". '

  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in yegor256/factbase, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-316](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

    -10 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of

  greeting: "I've analyzed the work policy document and reviewed the draft message
    to the programmer. Here's a rewritten version of the message that's more conversational,
    incorporates relevant points from the policy, and aims to be more motivating:\n\nHey
    there! Thanks for jumping in on this review. I've got some good news and some
    room for improvement for you.\n\nSo, here's the scoop: You've earned 15 points
    for this review. Not bad, but let me break it down for you:\n\nYou started with
    a solid 25-point base - that's automatic for every review. Nice! \n\nNow, I noticed
    you only left one comment. The policy encourages more engagement, aiming for at
    least 6 comments to avoid a 10-point deduction. Unfortunately, we had to apply
    that deduction here.\n\nBut hey, look on the bright side! You didn't review your
    own code (that would've cost you 40 points), and you showed up to participate.
    That's great!\n\nWant to boost your points next time? Here are some tips:\n1.
    Leave more comments - you can earn up to 20 points for that!\n2. If you're reviewing
    a larger piece of code (15+ hits-of-code), you'll avoid another 10-point deduction.\n3.
    The more substantial the code review, the more points you can rack up (up to 40
    points for the code size alone).\n\nYour current balance is -579, but don't let
    that discourage you. Every review is a chance to climb up. Remember, you can earn
    up to 100 points per review!\n\nKeep at it, and let's see those points soar. You've
    got this!"

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Great job on the review! You've snagged 24 points
    for this one. Here's the breakdown: 25 points as a base, plus 9 points for tackling
    those 93 hits-of-code (nice!). We had to deduct 10 points due to the low comment
    count (only 3), but don't sweat it! Remember, more comments can boost your score
    next time. Keep in mind, we're aiming for at least 6 comments and 15+ hits-of-code
    for maximum impact. Your current balance sits at [-535](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Keep up the great work and let's see those points climb! \U0001F4AA"

  greeting: "Hey there, awesome job on your contribution! \U0001F389 You've racked
    up +29 points: 25 for the base, and a sweet 9 points for your 197 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html).
    We did have to deduct 5 points due to the low comment count (only 4), but don't
    sweat it! Remember, more comments can boost your score next time. Keep the code
    coming and aim for that 80-point max! Your current balance is [+268](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Let's see you hit that 800 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    milestone soon – just watch out for that 15-point deduction! \U0001F609 [Keep
    up](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) the great work!"

    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request

    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request

    You've racked up a sweet +29 points: 20 for showing up and an extra 9 for those
    193 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html) you
    cranked out. That's some solid work, just shy of the 200 HOC mark where we start
    deducting points. Keep the code flowing, but remember, [quality matters](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    too! Your total score is now sitting pretty at [+240](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Keep up the great work and don't forget to engage with those code reviews – they
    can boost your points even higher!"

  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/baza.rb, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-526](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/pages-action, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-351](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

  details: It's time to reward @uchitsa for the code contributed in yegor256/judges#119,
    the reward amount is 5.
  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Thanks for your contribution, but it looks like
    we've got some room for improvement. You've earned +5 points, which is the minimum
    reward. Here's the breakdown: +20 base points, -15 for no code review (which is
    crucial!), -5 for only 1 comment (we need at least 5), and -10 for just 4 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    (aim for at least 20). We added +15 to keep you motivated. Remember, more code,
    reviews, and comments can significantly boost your points! Your current balance
    is [-12](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). Keep
    the contributions coming and focus on [quality and speed](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    – you've got this! \U0001F4AA"

  greeting: "\U0001F44B Great effort on your recent work! For future reference, we
    recommend [naming Git branches](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    after the ticket number you're addressing. For instance, \"`193`\" would be an
    ideal name for this case. This practice helps streamline our workflow. Your current
    branch name resulted in -12 points, but don't worry – your overall balance is
    still a strong [+120](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Keep up the good work, and let's aim for even better branch naming next time!

  greeting: Hello team member. We noticed that your branch name "`pull_unzip`" doesn't
    follow our naming convention. As per our [policy](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html),
    this results in a 12-point deduction. In the future, please name your branches
    after the ticket number you're working on (e.g., "`10`"). Your current balance
    is [+120](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). Let's
    ensure we stick to the guidelines moving forward to maintain consistency across
    our projects.

  commit: 5f5af672f4939af35a72bd1b44b45938b13dfa04
  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/pages-action, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [+20](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

  greeting: "Hey there, great job on your contribution! \U0001F389 You've snagged
    +8 points for this one: +16 for the base reward, but we had to deduct 8 points
    since your [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    (345) exceeded 200. Don't worry though, it's still a solid contribution! Remember,
    we aim for concise, impactful code. Keep the momentum going and [focus on quality](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    over quantity. Your current balance is looking good at [+573](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Keep up the great work!"

  commit: 1e7a21edd4f004386b8565a83fe56eda3470654f
  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/fbe, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-35](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

  commit: 669f622156bc99d60f9cdc94734df17635d10103
  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/baza, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-51](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

  greeting: "Hey there, awesome job on your contribution! \U0001F44D You've earned
    +4 points, which is our base reward. We had to deduct 8 points because your code
    was quite hefty (501 hits-of-code, over our 200 limit), and another 4 points due
    to the high number of review comments (23). But don't worry, we added 13 points
    to make sure you get something for your hard work. Your total balance is now [+565](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Remember, [quality over quantity](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    is key. Keep those contributions coming, and aim for more concise, well-reviewed
    code next time!"

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in yegor256/factbase, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-95](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

  commit: d07cb8143cff4b16aae27fba45f7efa24e34a8fc
  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/baza, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-111](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '

  award: 4
  details: It's time to reward @yegor256 for the code contributed in zerocracy/baza#228,
    the reward amount is 4.
  greeting: "Thanks for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there's
    room for improvement. Your +4 points break down as follows: +4 base, -8 for exceeding
    200 hits-of-code (1489), -16 for surpassing 800 hits-of-code, -16 for no code
    review, and -16 for no reviewer comments. We've added +56 to ensure a minimum
    reward. Remember, our [policy](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    values both quantity and quality. Aim for smaller, reviewed contributions next
    time. Your current balance is [-127](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html).
    Keep coding and improving! \U0001F4BB"

  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in zerocracy/swarm-template, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-123](https://zerocracy.github.io/judges-action/zerocracy-vitals.html). '
